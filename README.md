# Decentralized Digital Identity Lifecycle Management

A blockchain-based solution for secure, self-sovereign digital identity management with comprehensive lifecycle controls.

## Overview

This system empowers individuals and organizations to manage digital identities in a decentralized manner, maintaining control over their personal data while enabling verified credential exchange. Built on blockchain technology, it provides a trust framework that eliminates single points of failure and reduces dependence on centralized identity providers.

## Key Components

### Identity Provider Verification Contract

This contract establishes trust in the ecosystem by validating entities authorized to issue credentials.

- **Provider Registration**: Onboards and verifies legitimate credential issuers
- **Reputation Management**: Tracks issuer reliability and credential quality
- **Governance Participation**: Defines voting rights for trusted issuers
- **Trust Framework Enforcement**: Implements standards for credential issuers

### Attribute Management Contract

The core contract for managing the claims and assertions that comprise a digital identity.

- **Claim Creation**: Registers new identity attributes and assertions
- **Attribute Updates**: Manages changes to identity information over time
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures claims follow standardized formats
- **Selective Disclosure**: Controls granular sharing of identity information
- **Consent Management**: Records explicit authorization for attribute sharing

### Credential Revocation Contract

This contract handles the invalidation of credentials that are no longer valid or trustworthy.

- **Revocation Registry**: Maintains lists of revoked credentials
- **Temporal Controls**: Manages credential expiration and time-bound validity
- **Revocation Reasons**: Categorizes and documents reasons for invalidation
- **Status Verification**: Provides efficient proof of credential validity
- **Cascading Revocation**: Handles dependent credential invalidation

### Recovery Contract

Enables identity restoration and protection in cases of key compromise or loss.

- **Social Recovery**: Implements trusted guardian-based recovery mechanisms
- **Multi-signature Controls**: Requires multiple approvals for critical operations
- **Progressive Recovery**: Gradually restores access based on verification steps
- **Emergency Lockdown**: Provides rapid response for suspected compromise
- **History Preservation**: Maintains continuity of identity through recovery events

### Audit Trail Contract

Creates an immutable record of all significant identity lifecycle events.

- **Event Logging**: Records all material changes to identity attributes
- **Access Tracking**: Documents instances of credential verification
- **Privacy-Preserving Audit**: Implements zero-knowledge proofs for confidential audits
- **Compliance Support**: Structures audit data for regulatory requirements
- **Selective Disclosure**: Controls visibility of audit information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain environment
- Web3 provider
- Node.js v16+
- Solidity compiler v0.8.0+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/decentralized-identity-management.git

# Install dependencies
cd decentralized-identity-management
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <test-network>

# Deploy to production
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <main-network>
```

## Usage

### Identity Provider Registration

```javascript
// Register a new identity provider
await identityProviderContract.registerProvider(
  providerAddress,
  providerDetails,
  attestationDocuments
);

// Verify an identity provider (by governance)
await identityProviderContract.verifyProvider(
  providerAddress,
  verificationStatus
);
```

### Managing Identity Attributes

```javascript
// Add a new identity attribute
await attributeManagementContract.addAttribute(
  attributeSchema,
  attributeValue,
  issuerReference,
  expirationDate
);

// Update an existing attribute
await attributeManagementContract.updateAttribute(
  attributeId,
  newAttributeValue,
  updateReason
);

// Create a selective disclosure proof
const proof = await attributeManagementContract.createDisclosureProof(
  attributeIds,
  disclosureLevel
);
```

### Credential Revocation

```javascript
// Revoke a credential
await revocationContract.revokeCredential(
  credentialId,
  revocationReason,
  effectiveTimestamp
);

// Check credential validity
const isValid = await revocationContract.verifyCredentialStatus(
  credentialId
);
```

### Identity Recovery

```javascript
// Designate recovery guardians
await recoveryContract.assignGuardians(
  guardianAddresses,
  thresholdRequired
);

// Initiate recovery process
await recoveryContract.initiateRecovery(
  compromisedAddress,
  evidenceDocuments
);

// Guardian approval
await recoveryContract.approveRecovery(
  recoveryRequestId
);
```

### Audit Trail

```javascript
// Record an identity event
await auditTrailContract.recordEvent(
  eventType,
  eventDescription,
  relatedEntities
);

// Generate an audit report
const auditReport = await auditTrailContract.generateAuditReport(
  subjectAddress,
  startDate,
  endDate,
  eventTypes
);
```

## Security Considerations

- **Key Management**: Implement robust key rotation and management practices
- **Privacy Protection**: Use zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- **Sybil Resistance**: Employ mechanisms to prevent identity duplication
- **Secure Enclave Support**: Consider integration with hardware security modules
- **Denial-of-Service Protection**: Implement rate limiting and anti-spam measures
- **Metadata Protection**: Prevent correlation through transaction metadata
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular security audits are essential

## Interoperability

The system supports the following identity standards:

- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
- JSON-LD Credential Schema
- DID Authentication
- DID Resolution
- Universal Resolver compatibility

## Governance

The identity ecosystem is governed through a multi-stakeholder approach:

- **Technical Governance**: Protocol upgrades and standard implementations
- **Trust Framework**: Policies for credential issuers and verifiers
- **Dispute Resolution**: Processes for addressing contested claims
- **Compliance Management**: Alignment with regulatory requirements

## Privacy By Design

- **Minimal Disclosure**: Only necessary information is shared in transactions
- **Subject Control**: Identity owners maintain authority over their data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Clear boundaries on data usage are enforced
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential attributes are stored on-chain
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Support for credential deletion where appropriate
